# 1337-42-21sh
We move on to serious things! With 21sh, you will have to write an implementation close to the reality of the "read, eval, print" loop of a shell. Using the Termcaps library, you will add a functional and useful line edition to the "read" part of your shell. Cursor, Edit, History, Multiline, etc. But especially for the part "eval", forget the function ft_split that you used in your Minishell to cut off the command line entered by the user! 21sh will be your first realistic interpreter, and as such, this project will allow you to discover the lexical, syntactic, and semantic analyzes common to interpreters and compilers. With appropriate data structures and processing, adding pipe ("|") and redirection ("&lt;", "&lt;&lt;", ">>". ">") Management will be very simple!
